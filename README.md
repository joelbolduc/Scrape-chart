# Scrape-chart
This file contains a function that takes in a visual chart in bmp format (such as gdp over time) and returns a list of (x,y) pairs representing the data. Scaling information must be inputed manually (min and max of each axis, and weather the axis has a logarthmic scale or not). In a future version, conversion to csv file will be added.
TITLE SHOUDL BE CROPPED OUT OF THE IMAGE, OTHERWISE, THE ALGORITHM MIGHT CONFUSE THE TEXT AS PART OF THE FUNCTION'S CURVE, LEADING TO UNINTENDED RESULTS.
